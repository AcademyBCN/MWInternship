# INTERNSHIP MODERN WORKPLACE TECHNICAL SCENARIO
## Introduction
This exercise provides an opportunity for you to display your problem-solving and coding skills. During your interview, we would like you to present your solution, explain your approach, and highlight any noteworthy aspects of your code. The goal is not to find a right or wrong answer, but to understand your development skills, problem-solving strategies, and ability to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of your approach. Please ensure you read all the instructions before you begin.
To resolve this problem, no previous experience with the technologies used is required. We have ensured that you also have access to useful documentation.
If you haven't had the opportunity to work with React and APIs before, don't worry! We understand that everyone comes from different backgrounds and experiences. Below are some beginner-friendly tutorials that can help you get started:
-	[How to create a React App.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpjpq2ux04)
-	[How to make API requests with Axios.](https://codedamn.com/news/reactjs/axios-network-requests)
-	[React documentation.](https://react.dev/)
-	[How to add custom fonts in React.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0gjsLuZRsw)

## Scenario
In this company we are big fans of Star Wars, and as good fans, we are very interested in all the information about the movies, so we would like to have our own page with that information. That’s why we would like you to help us with this creating a solution with React, that through the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.py4e.com/documentation), shows all the data we are interested in.

### Tasks
Please complete the following tasks:

•	Create a React App that calls the Star Wars API and retrieves all the information of the films.
[Here](https://swapi.py4e.com/documentation#films) you have the endpoint that returns all the films.
•	Print all the information on a table.
Note: You just need to print the title of the film, the opening crawl, the director, the producer, the release date and the characters.
•	Style the page following the example we have provided at the end of this section.

### Additional tasks
Once the mandatory tasks are completed, consider the following enhancements:
-	As you may have seen, all the information related to the characters is a simple link. So, we would like to replace all those links with the names of the characters. 
[Here](https://swapi.py4e.com/documentation#people) you can find the endpoint that returns all the characters.

## Considerations
There is no need to deploy your solution; you can demonstrate it running on your local machine during the interview.
-	Where implementation details are not specified, you have the freedom to decide your approach.
-	During the interview, we will discuss your solutions and explore your approach to the tasks.
-	We do not expect your code to be perfect. Your code will serve as a basis for our discussion, and we are interested in understanding your approach to coding solutions.
-	There is no need to prepare a slide presentation unless you prefer to do so.
